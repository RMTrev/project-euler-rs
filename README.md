# Description

As a learning exercise in working with Rust in a practical setting, I will be revisiting
[my old Java implementations](https://github.com/RMTrev/euler) of Project Euler problems.

# Usage

To run, you will need the Rust development toolchain installed. Once that's done, run the following command:

```bash
cargo run problem [...args]
```

Where `problem` is the number of the problem to run, followed by zero or more additional parameters.
